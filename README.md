Added three methods:


## changeSkinPartial
*Accepts: (NSMutableDictionary *)slotsToReplace*

**Dictionary format:**
>attachment name : replacement texture

Replaces the texture of any nodes mentioned in the slotsToReplace dictionary with their accompanying textures. Creates an NSMutableDictionary in memory containing the original textures, to easily swap back.
*Note: be sure to use the attatchment name, not the slot name.*

Created to serve my own needs: I have an avatar builder in my Sprite Kit game, and I need to swap out specific slots without changing the whole skin (so the player can choose different shirts, pants etc.).

### Usage:

```
NSDictionary* partReplacement = @{@"torso": @"goblin-torso", @"head": @"goblin-head"};

[goblin changeSkinPartial:partReplacement];
```


### Limitations:
* Your dictionary's keys must match the slot names specified in the skeleton's .json file.
* If you need to replace any 'nested' nodes, you must create an entry for that slot in your dictionary.



## resetSkinPartial
Resets any changes made through changeSkinPartial; reverts the skeleton back to the textures used when the scene was created.
Should only be called after changeSkinPartial.


## colorizeSlots
*Accepts: (NSArray *)slotsToColorize withColor:(SKColor *)color andIntensity:(CGFloat)blendFactor*

Colorizes the slots listed in the slotsToColorize array using the specified color and blend factor.
*Note: be sure to use the attatchment name, not the slot name.*

Can be used to make a body part flash red, or to let the player change their hair/skin color.

### Usage:
```
NSArray* partsToColorize = @[@"head", @"left-shoulder", @"torso"];
SKColor* color = [SKColor redColor];
[boy colorizeSlots:partsToColorize withColor:color andIntensity:1];
```

### Limitations:
* Your array's values must match the slot names specified in the skeleton's .json file.
* If you need to colorize any 'nested' nodes, you must create an entry for that slot in your dictionary.
